  <h2>Hi, Pivotal Cloud Foundry team!</h2>
  <p>I'm Shaughnessy, a Product Manager in Denver who loves helping build good software. I have been working alongside developers, business stakeholders, designers, and other cross functional teams for five years.</p>
  <p>I have experience running product discovery projects, including problem definition, customer segmentation, user persona development, user research and validation. I also have experience working directly in an Agile product ownership capacity with teams of engineers, designers, and clients to build software that solves problems for clients and their users.</p>
  <p>(I'm still getting the hang of Flexbox, so please pardon the minimalism around here!)</p>

  <h2>My Thoughts on the Cloud Foundry CLI</h2>
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I initially started out with the tutorial on the PCF website, which was a very helpful into into the process. It was very simple and intuitive to understand how to use the CLI, where to find available commands, and push the app.
    <li>I ran into an initial problem in the tutorial when it wasn't entirely clear that I needed to log into my PWS account and set up a space to target. However, upon logging into the interface it was relatively intuitive to create the space and then to subsequently target it in the CLI.
    <li>In the first tutorial, I played around with scaling (memory and instances) and adding a database service using the command line.
    <li>For this sample app, I opted to try out creating a manifest.yml to set the PCF configurations.
